	Obviously the individual layout of any Wikipedia page can vary, but they are all consistent in attempting to present information in an easily accesible manner. One consistent feature across all the pages on Wikipedia is the toolbar on the right, which provides access to the main site and different languages. I chose to wireframe the page for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatherium"> <span style="color:blue">Megatherium</span></a></h3>, because who dosen't love the idea of a sloth the size of a small elephant? The sidebar on the left lays out some of the basic facts and taxonomy of the animal. The rest is standard Wiki layout, with headings that describe various sub-topics. The layout is basic, but it presents information well and also contains some really cool images.
