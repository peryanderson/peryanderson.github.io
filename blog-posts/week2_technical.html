            Wikipedia is easily my favorite website.  I keep a folder of all the interesting wikis I have come across, it contains easily over a hundred pages. The site design is simple, perhaps even minimalist. This I believe is because of the fact that anyone can edit Wikipedia, so it is important that the code can be edited by non-programmers.  Which brings me to the obvious point that makes Wikipedia so great: anyone can edit it. This has caused it to become the largest and most diverse repository of knowledge I have ever personally encountered. I have wikis bookmarked on everything from obscure Greek myths to graphic novels to bizarre natural phenomenon to elements of human sexuality I never could have imagined. Inaccuracies do of course exist, but there is a huge community of people, including myself, who take it upon themselves to correct any errors they find. The level of reliability is remarkable, and continues to improve.  In some ways I believe Wikipedia is more than just a website, I believe it represents a paradigm shift in the way humans store and share information. All of that and it is still free, and free of advertising.

            Netflix is great. To start with the obvious, the selection of movies and TV shows you get for the membership fee is huge. The site is laid out great and has a great array of features to optimize the user experience. I love being able to make a list of things I am interested in, and be able to go back to shows I discovered a year ago but never got around to watching. The home interface is great, and suggests shows based upon both the general viewing patterns of the user, as well as recommendations based on specific shows they watch. This is one of the only sites I have found that reliably recommends new content I am interested in. On top of that the site delivers high quality streaming video to me, even though my internet connection could be better. I am happy to pay for this level of service.

            I use IGN frequently, and I would definitely say it is one of my favorite websites. However, I personally dislike the actual site design. It is cluttered, glitzy, and often distracts from the content. The overly showy interface is cumbersome to the point where I usually use google to navigate to the page in IGN I want to reach, rather than from the IGN homepage. They insist on auto-loading videos on almost every page, and they have crashed my shockwave plugin countless times. Their worst offense though is easily the advertisements for completely unrelated products which will after some random delay begin playing at full volume. So then, you ask, why is IGN one of my favorite sites? Because despite the issues IGN has a great review staff, up to date news on games, and accurate and informative guides that I often rely on to get me out of tough spots. Itâ€™s where I go for news on games, and I often use it to guide my purchasing decisions. The content of the site is great, and ultimately that outweighs the negatives of a site design that is frankly trying too hard.
