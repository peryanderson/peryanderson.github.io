            While the distinction between margins, borders and padding can be initially hard to understand, it is absolutely neccesary to have a firm grasp on their relative positions in order to produce good code. I found the diagram on the right from w3schools very helpful. Padding is the area between the border of an element and the content presented within. Next we have the border, which may or may not be displayed. It is worth noting that unless the border-style property is set to a valid value the border cannot be displayed. Finally moving further out we have the margin, which defines the minimum space between the element and the next element. The difference between margins and borders is one of the more confusing issues when trying to place elements. If you have two objects with no margins, each with a 10 pixel black solid border, between them you will see 20 pixels of black. This is because each of them has its own 10 pixel black border and thus the two add together. Simple, right? Well in contrast, if take those same two objects and also add a 10 pixel margin to both, they will only have 10 pixels of space between the two borders, not 20. It is important to remember that a margin is defining the space between objects, not the space they fill. Thus the conditon of two 10 pixel margins can be met with 10 pixels of space. It is well worth pointing out another phenomenon regarding margins in the second set of paragraphs. You will notice in addition to being apart from each other they are also apart from the edge of the page, which we might not notice were borders not present. When formatting it is important to remember that margins count the edge of the page's body as an element they must also be spaced from.
