         <p class="article_content">
         A block is a block of code that is bordered by curly braces. Procs and Lambdas are two ways of saving a block in order
         to use it repeatedly without having to write it over and over again. There are three main differences between them. The fisrt
         is the syntax used to create them, Proc.new for procs, and lambda for lambdas. The second is that a proc does not check the number
         of arguments passed to it, while lambdas do. Third, a lambda is called in the context of a method and returns a value to that method, while a 
         proc returns the value directly.
