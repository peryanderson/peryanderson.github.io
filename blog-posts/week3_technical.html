            JavaScript is extremely popular in web design. It allows for the addition of client-side functionality. In orther words, it is an easy way to make a website respond to the actions of the user. Particularily helpful is the fact that these functions can be run locally on the users computer, which eases the interaction between the user and the server. Javascript is also almost completely object based, which makes the code easier to manipulate. JavaScript is also widely compatible, making it even more user-firendly.
