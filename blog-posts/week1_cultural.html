<h2 class="article_title">My Thoughts On DBC Culture</h2></a>
<p>
	I was attracted to DBC because of the intensity, and because I believe the skills that are taught are highly marketable. My job search process after graduating college was an unmitigated disaster. My degree is in biology, but I don't have experience in a professional laboratory setting. Given that and the current job market, it was almost impossible to find an entry level position. Also, I am not naturally gifted with manual dexterity, which is very important for hands-on research. A single twitch or slight tremor of the hand at the wrong moment can destroy months of work. That is exactly the wrong kind of stress for me. I have a highly analytical system of thought that I think meshes well with programming. I think I could be happy doing it, and I find it interesting.

	The intensity of the curriculum obviously worries me, as I think it should any sane individual. However, it is also what initially attracted me. Since I wanted to change careers before I even had one, I needed to learn a lot very quickly. I know I can thrive in Phase 1. Once I am fully committed to something like this, I am virtually unstoppable.  What really scares me is Phase 0. I am not nearly as good at self-regulating my work when I am not physically present in a learning environment. All I can do is put my shoulder to the wheel, keep committed  and push through. </p>

		Learning more about the culture has both excited and worried me. I understand naturally that everyone is accountable for their own learning. I understand the restaurant v. kitchen metaphor, DBC is not served to me, and it is an experience defined by my own input and effort. I have always thought that way about learning. To me it is self-evident, you cannot learn unless you learn, which is something that you, and not anyone else, does. Being accountable to myself is natural to me. Being accountable to twenty-four other people, all of whom are under intense pressure, well, it scares the hell out of me. I want people to be able to come to me for help and count on me. I really like it when I can help people. I do not want to let anyone down.
