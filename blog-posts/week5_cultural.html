<u>Parining</u><br>
Paring has overall been great for me. I have gained a surprising amount of knowledge from working with the other students. I would say though that in some ways pairing is frustrating. I definitely feel performance anxiety when I am pairing, and sometimes I think this comes across as me being rushed or overly intense. I am working to be more lighthearted in the sessions and not take my relative inexperience too seriously. The most rewarding pairing sessions for me are when the person I am pairing with and I have about the same skill level, whether or not it is sufficient to accomplish the task at hand. I feel this is when I and the person I am working with learn the most, because we are researching the same issues. <br> 
<u>Feedback</u><br>
I find interpreting the feedback I receive quite hard. The general criticism, when criticism is present, is that I seem rushed. I will work to address that, because I &#39;m really not rushed, I &#39;m nervous. It is good for me to hear that though, and I like that in general people feel I am confident with the learning competencies.  I find writing feedback hard, it is difficult for me to criticize other people unless there is something really obvious that needs addressing, so sometime I feel like I am nitpicking just to make my feedback actionable.<br>
