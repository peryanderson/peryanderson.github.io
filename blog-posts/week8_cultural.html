<h2 class="article_title">Conflict</h2></a>
<p>
On the ‘compass of shame’ I would say I am mainly in the avoidance category. In general though I am a low conflict person, I don’t really cause conflict myself and I’m good at resolving it. The last time I remember having real conflict in a work environment was last winter when I worked at UPS to pick up some extra cash. On a Thursday I seriously injured myself trying to lift something that was too heavy for me.  I later turned out to have a hernia. However, I still came into work on Friday, but I asked if I could leave because I felt like something was wrong. They asked me to stay, and I did. I ended up working through the day because they needed me on that shift, and I ended up driving straight to the hospital from work. My actions removed the conflict, but caused me to take an additional risk I shouldn’t have. I feel like I should have stood up for myself more, and insisted that I be allowed to leave to see a doctor. I learned that while avoiding conflict is good, sometimes it is necessary to stand your ground when faced with a serious issue.
