<p>
I am currently actively trying to develop a new personality trait, I would like to be more charismatic, and more emotionally intelligent in general. There are three basic elements of charisma : the ability to persuade others to follow you, the ability to make others feel good just by being around you, and the ability to get along and interact with anyone. I would say I am at about a two now, but I am trying to live up to this value more, because it is a great trait to have.
