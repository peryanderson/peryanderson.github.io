<h2 class="article_title">File Sharing</h2></a>
<p>
Illegal file sharing is an issue that will have to addressed in the near future. It is a current economic reality that music, movies, and software have become less costly to steal than to purchase. Virtually every movie and music album that can be bought can also be obtained illegally. <br>
The reason this is occurring is simple: because it can. As soon as internet speeds were great enough to allow the illegal sharing of files it was inevitable that it would occur. Due to the incredible volume of sharing that occurs it is not practical to punish everyone who participates in file sharing. <br>
There are some who make the argument that all information should be free, which I disagree with. Content takes work to generate, and that work has value.<br>
Sadly, there is currently no easy solution to this problem. Any action taken to completely restrict file sharing would violate people &#39;s right to privacy. Creating more and more elaborate written-in measures in programs has not proved to be an effective deterrent. Legal action is not practical at the scale on which file sharing occurs. Whatever solution  eventually emerges, if one does, we can only hope strikes a balance between the rights of artists and consumers.
