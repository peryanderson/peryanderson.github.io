<h2 class="article_title">Sterotype Threat</h2></a>
<p>
I do not feel comfortable discussing race, religion, or politics in a professional setting. This is for several reasons. First, it is simply not polite or appropriate. Second, people have very strong opinions on these topics and can easily become offended by discussions about them. Third, it is not possible to do these topics justice in this format. They are huge, multifaceted, complex constructs. There are entire fields of study devoted to them, and I am not educated in those fields. I discuss these topics only with people who I am very close to, and can have open conversations with. I do not blog about them.
