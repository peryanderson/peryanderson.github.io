<h2 class="article_title">Questions</h2></a>
<p>
I have not been very active positing questions in the Google+ community. I usually get the answers to my questions in my paring sessions or through research.  I suppose my issue is not so much knowing how to ask a good question, but rather knowing when to ask questions. I often donâ€™t when I should, and vice versa. When I do ask a question I put a great deal of effort into making it clear, specific, and concise. Perhaps I should have posted about more of the issues I encountered. The only time I can remember posting a question on the DBC forums, it was to state that I thought a link was broken. It turned out to be a problem with my active login on Github, and I felt a little embarrassed about having posted it. There are many more times I can recall when I should have posted to look for answers, and I will make better use of the Google+ community in the future. </p>
