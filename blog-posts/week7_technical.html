           SQL injection is when values are entered into databases that are actually code, often with malicious intent. These entries are executed when they are run through the code instead of just being stored, and can be used to destroy or access data. There are a couple of ways to prevent this, the most sure of which is manually examining every item that is being added to the database, but this is obviously impractical. It is also possible to run programs that check for patterns in the code being entered into the database, or to have the inputs run through the sql code as parameters rather than directly, so that they will not be run in the SQL code. There are also other types of databases on which data can be stored that are not vulnerable to this method, and can be interconverted into SQL databases.
