<h2 class="article_title">My Thoughts Learning Styles and Mindsets</h2></a>
<p>
	The result of my Gregoric thinking style quiz is a tie between concrete sequential and concrete random thinking styles. The provided table lists some qualities I would say apply to me, I do feel more comfortable working on my own, and I am a logical thinker.But I also am very imaginative, and I have no particular problem choosing only one answer or dealing with questions that have no single right answer. In fact I would say I enjoy abstract questions with no answers more than any other type. I decided to take the suggestion to do some research into learning theory and thinking styles, and I found that at best there are serious concerns regarding the merits of this system. Several of the journal articles I read raised issues about the efficacy of these categories. In particular the 2004 article &ldquo;Learning styles and pedagogy in post-16 learning. A systematic and critical review&rdquo;, raises serious issues with learning theory. Analysis of Gregorc&#39;s data reveals that he does not have any reliable statistical evidence on which to support his claims. In short there is not reliable evidence that I learn a particular way based on my response to these fifteen questions. Even ignoring that the data doesn&#39;t support Gregorc&#39;s claims, common sense raises a few concerns on it&#39;s own. Given the wild diversity of human minds and the power of human thought, it is not plausible that a scematic based on two variables is an adequate tool for categorizing the means by which humans learn.

	I am not saying none of this advice is helpful, or suggesting that we don't all closely examine how we learn. I think we should consider the problem of how to be the best version of ourselves at an individual level. In my case main barriers to learning in unit one were definitely trying to keep far too obsessive notes, and poor time management. I have switched to a more general and abstract style of taking notes, and I will be making day-plans during unit two to schedule my time. I think these changes will improve how well I learn as well as the quality of my life.

	I certainly agree that believing one can accomplish a task raises the probability that one will accomplish it. I do think everyone has different opinions about their potiential for improvement in different areas, that people don't fall wholly into one category or the other on all issues. There is certainly evidence that the mind is not a fixed object, and the more effort and belief you put in the better results you can get out of it. Treating this as a binary distinction is oversimplifying the issue a bit, but the core of it is still good advice. I do believe I can become a great programmer, and I hope that belief serves me well.
