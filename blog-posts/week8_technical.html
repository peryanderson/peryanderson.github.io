         <p class="article_content">
          The internet is a means by which informatio0n can easily and quickly be transferred between computers. Each computer, whether it be a desktop, laptop, phone or tablet, accesses the information on the internet in the same, systematic way. Each computer sending or receiving information possesses its own IP address, which works like a telephone number, it identifies the device. Of course it is more complex and long than a phone number, and we have to keep making them longer because we keep running out, but that is aside from the point. What actually happens when you go to access a webpage is that your computer gets in touch with a domain name system, or DNS. To extend the telephone metaphor, the DNS can be said to fill the role of the operator. It takes the webpage address you requested, translates it back to an IP, and finds the corresponding computer which then begins to send information back to the requesting computer, not necessarily proceeding through the same path. The computer hosting the site is referred to as the host, and any type of computer can host a webpage. However, usually webpages are hosted on servers, computers that are specialized for this task. The information is then broken into little blocks called packets to make transmission faster. Each packet is a combination of compressed information and an identification of where it belongs when the final webpage loads. The reason that all of these systems can function, and the webpage can load, is because the internet follows protocols, or sets of instructions that all the computers have agreed to understand. Without protocols the only way to transfer information would be to directly connect to another individual computer. These protocols define how information is requested and delivered through the internet, which essentially creates the concept of the internet.
