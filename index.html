            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
            Hello everyone at DBC! My name is Perry Anderson. I am currently twenty-four years old. I graduated from Bard College last summer with a B.A. in Biology. I love bizarre biological and medical facts. My favorite museum is the M&uuml;tter Museum in Philadelphia, check it out if you have a chance. I was also attracted to Biology because at its core it is all about complex interacting systems. I have a highly analytical and logical mental approach to life, which allowed me to really engage with the material. After graduating I had a lot of difficulty finding an entry-level research position, and I became increasingly unsure if research was right for me. I was attracted to DBC because of the intensity, and because I believe the skills that are taught are highly marketable. I also believe that computers, like life, are all about the interaction of systems, so I think my mindset will serve me well in this environment.
            </p>
            <p>
            In terms of my interests I am kind of a nerd. I love videogames, anime, manga, and graphic novels. I also play magic the gathering occasionally, but I am horrible at it. I&#39;m also on Hearthstone, look for the username SuperPants if you want to challenge me. Don&#39;t blame me for the name, it&#39;s the random generator&#39;s fault.

            <h2>Current Events in the Life of Perry</h2>
            <p>I am still working my way through Dark Souls 2. I like everything except the huge difficulty drop compared to Dark Souls, and the fact that there is no DLC bundle deal for Xbox. I'm reading the book Fast Food Nation, which reads sort of like a modern non-narrative version of The Jungle. But with more of an emphsis on the economy that creates the situation and less disjointed babbling about agrarian socialisim. It&#39;s a great book, but it is not for the squeamish. 
            </p>
            <p>Coding went a lot better this week than last. I like the new tools I am working with, and my schedule wasn&#39;t nearly as strained. I really learned a lot, and got a lot more comfortable working with HTML and CSS. I cannot overstate how stressed my schedule became last week, and how glad I am that this week went relatively smoothly.
