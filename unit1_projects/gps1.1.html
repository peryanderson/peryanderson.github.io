        <h3>Driver and Navigator Pairing </h3>
        <p>The driver is responsible for writing the code and the navigator is responsible for leading the driver and defining the direction of the project. Division of labor in this way allows the driver to focus on writing good code, and frees the navigator to manage workflow and design. </p>
        <h3>Reflections</h3>
        <p> I think our pairing session went well. This was actually my second paring session, it was a very different experience working with someone from DBC watching my progress. We were able to adress the goals set out before us efficiently, and we both definitely learned new tricks from each other. I do feel the driver-navigator roles are a little tricky to maintain. I find myself wanting to code when I am navigating, and wanting to give input on the process when I am driving. I will strive to improve that in the future. </p>
