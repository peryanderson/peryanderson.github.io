# U1.W2: Responsive Web Design - Pairing Challenge!

## Learning Competencies
- Describe responsive design
- Determine whether responsive design is good or bad practice
- Make a small site responsive
- Compare responsive design and fluid layouts


## Summary

We think of the web and websites as mostly static. They look the way
they look. But it's really more complicated than that.  Browsers and
operating systems make things look different. Then, smart phones arrived
and made everything crazy.  Web designers and developers spend a lot of
time thinking about how to make web pages usable in all the possible
formats (phones, tablets, web) while keeping them maintainable (i.e. not
taking a billion years to make small changes). Responsive design is one
of the ways developers have created to make sites usable, maintainable, and
adaptable to new devices and browsers.


## Release 0: Research before you pair

Research responsive web design and fluid layouts. What are they? Why are they used? We've put a couple resources below, but there are a ton of great resources online waiting for you to find them! Then take a look at the accompanying HTML file to see what information you'll want to include. Keep the information close so you have it ready when you pair!

- Slides: [Introduction to Responsive Web Design and Compatability](http://girldevelopit.github.io/gdi-core-intermediate-html-css/class4.html#/1)
- Read: [Beginners guide to responsive web design](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/beginners-guide-to-responsive-web-design)
- Read: [Fixed vs. Fluid vs. Elastic Layout: Whatâ€™s The Right One For You?](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/06/02/fixed-vs-fluid-vs-elastic-layout-whats-the-right-one-for-you/)
- Read: [Responsive Web Design: Fluid Layouts](http://www.sitepoint.com/responsive-web-design-fluid-layouts/)

Additional required resources for you to consider:
- Slides: [Web Accessibility](http://girldevelopit.github.io/girldevelopit-rdu-access/classslides.html#/)
- Read: [Change your browsers user agent](http://osxdaily.com/2013/01/16/change-user-agent-chrome-safari-firefox/)


## Release 1: Share your knowledge with your Pair

Get together with your pair. Using the accompanying starting-point.html file, add the information you learned from your research (don't forget to cite your sources in the "references" section). Discuss your understanding of the concepts with your pair to make sure you are both on the same page.

## Release 2: Responsify with your pair

With such a multitude of devices with different screen sizes, it is important to create a web layout that is not tied to a certian screen resolution.

Think about how you want the website to look from a desktop monitor, a cell phone, and a tablet. Resize your screen to mimic those sizes and see where the layout falls apart. Then you can use media queries to target these pixel dimensions.

If you are using chrome, you can open the Chrome Dev Tools and start resizing the browser window. This will display the pixel dimensions in the top right of the screen.

Here is a comprehensive resource on media queries: [MDN docs on media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Media_queries)

Here is a website that compiles examples of great usage of media queries: [mediaqueri.es](http://mediaqueri.es/)

Here is a more practical guide: [alistapart on media queries](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design) It is old but there is still a lot of good info there.

Cross browser normalization can be a pain, check out how well your website works on different browsers :[QuirkTools](http://quirktools.com/screenfly)


## Release 3: Reflect (individually)
Reflect on your learning in the "reflection" div on your site. This section should be completed on your own, but you should style it with your pair.

## Release 4: Commit and push your changes
This site should be initially kept in your phase-0-unit-1 repository, but we also want you to make it live on your github.io site.

## Release 5: Publish
Using the terminal, practice copying the html and css sheets into a new folder in your [USERNAME]github.io site. Commit and push your changes to your github.io site. Double check that everything is displaying  properly. Then add a link on the index of your site to make sure people can learn from your example!

## Optimize your learning
If you want more resources or time to build a responsive site, consider going through the [Treehouse: Build a Responsive Website](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-responsive-website) which takes approximately 1.5-2 hours, or any tutorial offered in this blog [16 really useful responsive design tutorials](http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/16-really-useful-responsive-design-tutorials-71410085). Each of these tutorials will take a couple hours of dedication.
