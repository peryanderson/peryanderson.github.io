   <h2> Responsive Design </h2>
      
      Responsive design is simply, design to the user. It involves several different facets, such as reformatting the information on a site based on what kind of device it is being used. The philosophy of responsive design is that a site should respond to how the user interacts with it. 
      Here are some of the sources that we found useful.

   <h2> Fluid Layouts </h2>
      Fluid layouts are layouts that are based on fluid girds, that is the size of particular sections are defined as percentages of the screen that they occupy, rather than pixel lengths. This allows for resizing and responsive design. Fluid layouts do not on their own constitue representative design, but they are an important element of it.

    <h2> Conclusion </h2>
      Discuss the purpose of responsive design and fluid layouts and whether
      you think it's good practice to use them.
      Add html tags where necessary.
      
      Responsive design has become increasingly important due to the greatly increased types of screens that people use - from the smallest cell phone screens to the largest 4k monitors. Responsive design isn't always the best approach - directing users to alternate mobile sites is also a viable option. Responsive design and fluid layouts give a lot of flexibility, but make it difficult from a graphic design perspective. Pixel accurate image design becomes difficult to achieve when having to plan for so many different layouts.

    <h2> Reflection </h2>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>How was it to implement these concepts?</li>
        <p>Fun. This site has fairly simple content, it was nice to be able to create a responsive design, and I had a great time pairing. </p>
        <li>How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?</li> 
        <p>They have obviously had a huge impact. A greater variety of devices on which to view web sites means a greater demand on designers to make their work compatible with a huge new variety of technology. As for the future, it is always hard to predict. If the current trends continue we can expect people to consume media in even more varied ways. Content will continue to be designed for viewing on specific devices, but responsive design will become more and more important</p>
        <li>How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?</li> 
        <p>I can't speak intelligently about what it is like to experience the internet, or the world, as a visually impaired person. Helping the visually impaired is certainly noble, and this includes the development of tools, whether they be programs or physical devices, that allow them to better interact with the internet.   </p>
        <li>What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?</li> 
        <p>I really liked learning about how this works, I had never really stopped to analyze how sites resize themselves and respond to these kinds of changes. The only thing that completely flummoxes me is HTML5 backwards compatibility issues. </p>
